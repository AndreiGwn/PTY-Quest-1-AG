# Quest1 <AndreiGwn> - Unity 3D Project

This is a Unity 3D project created as part of a challenge-based assignment.  
The project includes various gameplay mechanics like jumping, teleportation, lighting control, and puzzle design.


## Getting Started

1. Create a new 3D project in Unity.  
   Name the project something like `Quest1_<YourName>`.
2. Download the provided Unity Asset package.
3. Open the Unity project and import the asset by double-clicking the `.unitypackage` file.

## Challenges Overview

###  Challenge 1: JumpyJumpy
Add force to the player when the `//Challenge 1` comment is found in the code.  
The player should launch upwards into the air.

###  Challenge 2: Teleport Player
When the player touches the **TeleportA** platform, they should be instantly moved to the **TeleportB** platform.

###  Challenge 3: Deactivate Object
Once a player uses a teleport platform, that platform should be disabled to prevent repeated teleportation.

###  Challenge 4: Illuminate Area
After the player is teleported, a small light should turn on at the next area they need to go to.

###  Challenge 5: Blink World Light
Use a coroutine to briefly turn on the main world light and then turn it off again.  
This gives the player a quick flash of the entire level before it goes dark again.

###  Challenge 6: Teleport Player Random
Instead of teleporting from A to B, teleport the player to a **random** platform like C, D, or E.

###  Challenge 7: Design a Puzzle
Now that the bounce, teleport, and lighting mechanics are working, use them to build a puzzle level.  
You can redesign the current level or create a completely new scene from scratch.

## Unity Version

Recommended: **Unity 2022.3.56f LTS** or later.
